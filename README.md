# Hank's Startpage

![](./startpage.png)

This is a straightfoward startpage I created for personal use. See sources below for what helped me in it's creation. Most of the images I've used have been sourced from across the Internet. 

**Features:**
- Random Image Selection
- Date, Time, and Weather
- DuckDuckGo Search Bar

Weather is done through OpenWeatherMap.
